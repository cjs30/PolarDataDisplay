# PolarDataDisplay
Display program for data collected by WebPolarReader

This is a Javascript program that reads the data files produced by WebPolarReader and plots traces using Poltly. It also calculated heart rate (labelled) bpm for each device. There is a feature to allow alignment of the devices. To do this switch on the bpm traces from each device and zoom into an area where there is a 'feature' that is recognizable on all of the traces. Then check the zeroing box and click on the feature on each trace. When you have selected each trace it will align them and display the time offsets. You will need to have a play to get the hang of it! The program does NOT write back to the original datafiles and reloading the program is the easiest way to restart.
